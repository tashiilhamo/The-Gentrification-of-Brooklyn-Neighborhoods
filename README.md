Project Overview

Brooklyn has experienced rapid and uneven gentrification over the last two decades. This project analyzes neighborhood-level change through maps, visuals, and demographic data using ArcGIS StoryMaps.

Our StoryMap highlights how rising income levels, increased rental prices, shifts in racial demographics, and new developments have reshaped communities such as Williamsburg, Bushwick, Crown Heights, and Bedford-Stuyvesant.

The goal is to help viewers understand who benefits, who is displaced, and how the character of these neighborhoods has changed.

Objectives
	•	Identify Brooklyn neighborhoods experiencing the most significant gentrification.
	•	Analyze demographic shifts (income, race, age, education).
	•	Examine housing trends, including rental increases and new developments.
	•	Visualize these changes through interactive ArcGIS maps.
	•	Present findings in a clear and accessible StoryMap.

  Key Findings from the StoryMap
	•	Williamsburg & Bushwick show some of the most dramatic demographic shifts, linked to rising rent prices and new businesses.
	•	Crown Heights & Bed-Stuy have seen major increases in median household income and rapid changes in racial composition.
	•	Visual maps reveal clusters of gentrification hot spots concentrated near subway corridors and waterfront areas.
	•	Census and city datasets show consistent patterns of displacement and increased cost of living.
